OMERO.figure scripting
======================

Description
-----------

We can use JavaScript in the browser console to script changes to a
figure. This is an experimental feature and not documented.
In this example, we will automatically add labels based on analysis results.

Setup
-----

-  Install the OMERO.figure web app as described at https://pypi.org/project/omero-figure/
-  Upload the script :download:`Split_View_Figure.py <../scripts/Split_View_Figure.py>` to the OMERO scripting service

Resources
---------

-  Any multi-channel images, e.g. from `siRNAi-HeLa <https://downloads.openmicroscopy.org/images/DV/siRNAi-HeLa/>`__
-  Any time-lapse images, e.g. `FRAP <https://downloads.openmicroscopy.org/images/DV/will/FRAP/>`__.

Step-by-Step
------------

Figure creation in Python
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

OMERO.figure files are simply JSON data, stored in OMERO File Annotations with a specific
namespace of omero.web.figure.json. We can create these files using Python scripts, uploaded to
the OMERO.scripting service to make them available to all OMERO users.

The format of the JSON is described at https://github.com/ome/omero-figure/blob/master/docs/figure_file_format.rst.
We will use the example :download:`Split_View_Figure.py <../scripts/Split_View_Figure.py>` script.

#. Select a few images in the webclient.

#. Click on the Script button \ |script_icon|\  in the top-right of the webclient and choose the
   ``Split_View_Figure.py`` script (e.g. under Workshop Scripts).

#. Run the script. When complete, open the OMERO.figure app and File > Open.

#. Choose the most recent figure, called "Split View Figure".


Figure editing in JavaScript
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We will use the time-lapse images listed above to create a FRAP figure but you can use any time-lapse images.

    .. image:: images/script_frap_figure.png
       :scale: 75 %
       :align: center

#.  To see the data model for any current file in OMERO.figure, go to *File > Export as JSON...*.

#.  You will see that the ``panels`` list defines the panels and each panel has attributes. For example, a panel with a single white label might include the following attributes:

    ::

        "name": "image1.tiff",
        "labels":[{"text":"label text","size":12,"position":"topleft","color":"FFFFFF"}],
        "x": 200, "y", 200, "width": 100, "height": 100,
        ...many other attributes not shown...

#.  The ``figureModel`` variable is accessible in the console. We can use ``figureModel.getSelected()`` to get selected panels and for each panel we can call ``p.set()`` to change an attribute.

#.  For example, to set the ``height`` of each selected panel to ``200``, we can do:

    ::

        figureModel.getSelected().forEach(function(p){
            p.set('height', 200)
        });

#.  We can use AJAX to load JSON data and we will use ``p.add_labels()`` to create labels.

#.  In this example we will load the FRAP intensities from the Map Annotations on these images.

#.  Select 2 FRAP images that have previously been analysed to create a ``Map Annotation`` with the namespace ``demo.simple_frap_data``.

    .. image:: images/script_map_ann_analysis.png
       :scale: 75 %

#.  Alternatively, you can add your own ``Map Annotation`` with each *Key* being a *T-index* (start at 0), and the *Value* will be a FRAP intensity (number).

    .. image:: images/script_map_ann_manual.png
       :scale: 75 %

#.  Create a Figure with 2 images.

#.  Copy and paste each image several times and increment T-index in the Preview panel to show multiple time-points per image.

#.  Open the browser console by *right-click > Inspect Element (Firefox)* or *right-click > Inspect (Chrome)* and click on the *Console* tab.

#.  Copy the code from https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ome/training-scripts/v0.6.0/practical/javascript/figure_frap_mapannotation_label.js

#.  Drag to select the FRAP movie images in the figure.

#.  Paste the code into the console. **Do not hit enter yet.**

#.  Inspect the code. It will iterate through each of the **selected** panels, an AJAX call is made to load the Map Annotations with the namespace that we created from FRAP values above.

#.  NB: If you manually created your own Map Annotation above, you can remove the line ``url += '&ns=' + ns;`` to avoid filtering by namespace.

#.  The FRAP values are a list of ``[key, value]`` pairs and we can get the value for the current T index of the panel with ``values[theT][1]`` and use this to create a label.

#.  Hit Enter to run the code on selected panels.

#.  The labels should be added. Note that you can undo and redo these changes in the UI as normal.
